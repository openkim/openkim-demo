    "As the final demo we show how to use advanced querying to construct a thermodynamic convex hull from the results of the new [EquilibriumCrystalStructure test driver](https://openkim.org/id/EquilibriumCrystalStructure__TD_457028483760_000) and compare them to reference data. A [convex hull](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06901.pdf) is a common product of of DFT materials discovery databases such as AFLOW. Compounds on the hull, and only those on the hull, are predicted to be stable. Now that OpenKIM is able to compute properties for arbitrary multi-species crystals, we can compare the hulls computed by interatomic potentials to those computed by DFT.\n",

    "*Note that for now we have only created tests and reference data for the AFLOW-ICSD catalog, so the number of structures is sparse and the reference data was computed using the Hubbard U correction, which is not the preferred type of calculation for convex hull construction. Stay tuned as we incorporate all 3.5 million materials from AFLOW!*\n",
